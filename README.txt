  This C++ code is designed to control a buzzer based on the input from a sensor. The sensor is connected to pin 1 (sense_pin),
  and the buzzer is connected to pin A5 (buzzer_pin). The code checks the status of the sensor, and if the sensor reads HIGH (1),
  it activates the buzzer with a specific pattern. If the sensor reads LOW (0), the buzzer remains silent.

  Components:
  - Arduino board with a connected buzzer and sensor.

  Pin Configuration:
  - Buzzer Pin: A5
  - Sensor Pin: 1

  Wiring:
  - Connect the positive (anode) of the buzzer to A5.
  - Connect the sensor to pin 1.

  Usage:
  - Upload this code to an Arduino board.
  - Ensure the buzzer and sensor are correctly connected.
  - Observe the behavior of the buzzer based on the sensor input.

  Note:
  - Adjust the delay values and analogWrite parameters for different patterns and tones.
  - This code assumes a simple HIGH/LOW sensor input. Modify the logic for more complex sensor inputs.
